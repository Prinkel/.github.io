    <title> 250 Word Response</title>
    <body> <p> Never thought to make a short essay on a website instead on a usual Word document. I’m actually typing first this text on Word before placing it in my code. This text made me thinking about the presence of information and design of a (responsive) website. It has become too self-evident that a website is presentable on a many devices. And yes, even though I am a Nillies Boy born in ’97, I still remember the smooth ear pleasant sounds of the dial up modem and of course the non responsive websites, where you had to scroll vertical and horizontal to read a text on a site. I have some basic experience with making a website and the struggle about the responsiveness and lags are relatable. I did not expect the bad critics on the Mac Pro Website, before this article I have seen the website already, and I thought it was so nice and on point. But I fully understand the lags, heavy weight of the webpage. The website of Raf Simons about the Summer collection 2017? It was a disaster, my laptop turned into a frying pan. I see the author giving examples about standards in website design, and I really like how he categorises it. It gives me structure and insight. Introducing David Hockey’s photographical work really made me even see more things. The world of a website is not defined by his canvas. The canvas is fluid, it changes all the time. We have so many different devices to surf the internet on, and these devices evolve everyday. I really like how Hockey, besides the website topic captures his photos and how he marks a moment of time into something transient. Technology is indeed evolving and not replacing other different technology, a little screened phone can never kill the big screen television. It evolves with our needs, and nowadays we have more needs, because of the more technology.
